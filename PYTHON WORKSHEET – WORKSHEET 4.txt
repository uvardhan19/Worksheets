Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly
11. Differentiate between a compiler and an interpreter? Which of them is used in python language?
Ans: Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code. Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into machine code at once. An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code.
Interpreter is used as the python programming language.
12. What is the purpose of the PYTHONPATH environment variable?
Ans: PYTHONPATH is an environment variable which you can set to add additional directories where python will look for modules and packages. For most installations, you should not set these variables since they are not needed for Python to run.
13. How will you remove all the leading and trailing whitespaces in a string in python? Give one example.
Python String strip() function will remove leading and trailing whitespaces. If you want to remove only leading or trailing spaces, use lstrip() or rstrip() function instead.
s1 = '  abc  '


print(f'String =\'{s1}\'')


print(f'After Removing Leading Whitespaces String =\'{s1.lstrip()}\'')


String ='  abc  '
After Removing Leading Whitespaces String ='abc  '
