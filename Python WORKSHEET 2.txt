Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly


            11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.
Answer-
            1. List and tuple are sequences, where the dictionary is a hash table of key value pairs.
            2. List and tuple are the ordered collection of items, a dictionary is an unordered collection of items.
            3. Dictionaries and lists are mutable where it is possible to add new items or delete any item which is not needed, tuple is an immutable object where addition or subtraction of the items are not possible.
            4. List items are enclosed in square [ ] brackets , tuples are round ( ) brackets and dictionary is with curly { } brackets
            5. Items in dictionary are not indexed, where list and tuples are indexed
            6. Examples:
L1=[10, "shyam", "B.Com FY", 75]  = list
T1=(10, "shyam", "B.Com FY", 75) =  tuple
D1={"Rollno":10, "class":"B.com FY", "percentage":75} = dictionary


            12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’with space in python.
Answer- 
Under python , strings are immutable, we can overwrite the values of immutable items, it makes it easy to lay it out at the construction time which is fixed and unchanging storage requirements.
Code:


import re
a_string = "I+LOVE+PYTHON"
new_string = a_string.replace("+", " ")
new_string




            13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with an example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python.
Answer-
ord() is a function in python which is used to convert the character to an integer where chr() is the opposite or reverse of ord().
For Example : In the below example I am going to find the unicode code point value of a character: Unicode code point of a alphabet:
In - print("The ASCII value of a is",ord('a'))
Output - The ASCII value of B is 97
             Simple syntax could be used to find out the datatype of a variable in python that is:
             type(<VARIABLE_NAME>)
              Such as , 
              Input: 
              a=10
              print(type(a))
              Output: <class ‘int’>
