D) All of the above.
Ans: A & C
Q11 is subjective answer type question, answer it briefly.
11. List any two major differences between lists and sets in python.
Ans: Lists and tuples are standard Python data types that store values in a sequence. Setsare another standard Python data type that also store values. The major difference is that sets, unlike lists or tuples, cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element and store unordered values. Some more differences are: List can be 2-D whereas a set can't. As list are ordered, lists are comparatively slow to execute whereas sets are fast.
Q12 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.
12. write a python program to square the elements of a list by using list comprehension.
13. Write a pyhton program to drop duplicate elements from a list of numbers.
14. Take two sets of numbers and try implementing the set operations - intersection, union, difference and
symmetric_difference between them.
15. Write a python program to add the elements of a set.
