Q11 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.


11. Write a python program to find the factorial of a number.
Ans: 
# change the value for a different result
num = 11


# To take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))


factorial = 1


# check if the number is negative, positive or zero
if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   for i in range(1,num + 1):
       factorial = factorial*i
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)




12. Write a python program to find whether a number is prime or composite.
Ans: 
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  
  
if num > 1:  
   for i in range(2,num):  
       if (num % i) == 0:  
           print(num,"is not a prime number")  
           print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)  
           break  
   else:  
       print(num,"is a prime number")  
         
else:  
   print(num,"is not a prime number")  




13. Write a python program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not.
Ans: 
def isPalindrome(s):
     
    # Using predefined function to 
    # reverse to string print(s)
    rev = ''.join(reversed(s))
 
    # Checking if both string are 
    # equal or not
    if (s == rev):
        return True
    return False
 
# main function
s = "utkarsh1hsraktu"
ans = isPalindrome(s)
 
if (ans):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")




14. Write a Python program to get the third side of right-angled triangle from two given sides.
Ans: 
def pythagoras(opposite_side,adjacent_side,hypotenuse):
        if opposite_side == str("x"):
            return ("Opposite = " + str(((hypotenuse**2) - (adjacent_side**2))**0.5))
        elif adjacent_side == str("x"):
            return ("Adjacent = " + str(((hypotenuse**2) - (opposite_side**2))**0.5))
        elif hypotenuse == str("x"):
            return ("Hypotenuse = " + str(((opposite_side**2) + (adjacent_side**2))**0.5))
        else:
            return "the answer!"
    
print(pythagoras(3,4,'x'))
print(pythagoras(3,'x',5))
print(pythagoras('x',4,5))
print(pythagoras(3,4,5))




15. Write a python program to print the frequency of each of the characters present in a given string.
Ans: 
# initializing string  
test_str = "utkarshmeanstoriseup9996618372122"
  
# using naive method to get count of each element in string  
all_freq = {} 
  
for i in test_str: 
    if i in all_freq: 
        all_freq[i] += 1
    else: 
        all_freq[i] = 1
  
# printing result


print ("Count of all characters in utkarshmeanstoriseup9996618372122 is :\n "
                                        +  str(all_freq))
